# NFL_4th_Down_Go-For-It_Project

## Motivation
As a football fan, I noticed a league-wide trend where it felt like more teams were going for it on 4th down. After the 2021 NFL regular season ended, I came across a [tweet](https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez/status/1481096715235217413) from Michael Lopez who is the Director of Football Data and Analytics for the NFL. This sparked my interest in digging deeper into the numbers to find the league-wide trends in go-for-it rates. I wanted to also to find if there was a benefit to going-for-it in 4th and short situations as well as how often teams went for it in such situations in the 2021 season. Additionally, this gave me a great opportunity to work on my data visualization skills with interactive plots using plotly and plots with NFL team logos. 

## Data
The [data](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data) comes from nflfastR which has scraped NFL play-by-play data from the 1999 NFL season. Since I had no experience in working with nflfastR, I found a great Python tutorial from [@Deryck97](https://gist.github.com/Deryck97) which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Deryck97/dff8d33e9f841568201a2a0d5519ac5e).

## League-Wide Go-For-It Rate in 4th and short opportunities
I wanted to first re-create the plot that Michael Lopez tweeted out. I used data from the past 15 seasons starting from the 2007 season. I did this by isolating the data with 4th-and-1, 4th-and-2, and 4th-and-3 opportunies. I then grouped by season and took the probability of going-for-it by dividing the number of passes and runs over the total sum of fourth-and-short plays. I also subsetted the data using win probability in order to remove garbage time plays. Here is the final result and an interactive version of the plot can be found [here](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~slingam00/36/#/):

We see a dramatic increase in teams going-for-it on 4th-and-1 in this past season at almost twice the rate as four seasons prior. We also see that more teams went-for-it on 4th-and-2 in 2021 than teams went-for-it in 2011 on 4th-and-2. This shows that teams are being more aggressive in trying to keep a drive going in order to maximize the number of points they can score in a given drive.

## WPA/EPA plots

The next thing that I wanted to look at was if over these past fifteen years, were teams having success in going-for-it in these 4th-and-short situations where 4th-and-short is described as 4th-and-3 and less. In order to calculate this, I used WPA (Win Probability Added) and Expected Points Added (EPA). WPA describes the amount in which a team's win probability in a game increased or decreased based on a given play. EPA is based on EP (Expected Points) which attempts to quantify the expected points of scoring based on a given down and distance since not all yards gained are the same. EPA measures how well a team performs relative to the expectation. From [The 33rd Team](https://www.the33rdteam.com/epa-explained/), "say the Chiefs start with the ball first-and-10 from their own 25-yard line, where its expected points would be about 1.06. If Patrick Mahomes throws a 15-yard completion, making it first-and-10 on the KC 40-yard line, where the expected points is now 1.88, the EPA of that play would be 1.88 â€“ 1.06 or 0.82".

Given these two metrics, I took the median WPA and EPA per season of 4th-and-short plays and grouped by the different play types of pass, run, field goal, and punt. Here are the plots and the interactive versions can be found for [WPA](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~slingam00/38/#/) and [EPA](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~slingam00/38/#/).
